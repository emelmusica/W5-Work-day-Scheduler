# W5-Work-day-Scheduler

Week 5 Challenge "Work Day Scheduler"

Deployed Application Link: https://emelmusica.github.io/W5-Work-day-Scheduler/

For this challenge we are meant to build a simple work day scheduler that falls within the criteria provided:

Given I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

When I open the planner

Then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

When I scroll down

Then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm

When I view the time blocks for that day

Then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

When I click into a time block

Then I can enter an event

When I click the save button for that time block

Then the text for that event is saved in local storage

When I refresh the page

Then the saved events persist

With the starter code provided I was able to focus primarily on the javascript portion of this challenge that required us to use DayJS and all the other fundamentals that we've learned in the past two weeks along with some html and css implemented into this activity.

With the help from google as well as Vince from the Friday night Group tutoring sessions, I was able to make my way through this challenge rather quickly. I'm still wrapping my brain around how to write javascript code and it's functions etc but with google, Vince and my friend who thankfully is very willing to help me when I need... I've been able to finish this project on time.

I aslo found some completed work day schedulers from past students of similar courses that helped me understand the direction I needed to go. I only used those as a resource/reference and in no way did I utilise their written code for my own project.
